## How does it works ?
*Soggfy works by intercepting Spotify's OGG parser and capturing the unencrypted data during playback. This process is similar to recording, but it results in an exact copy of the original files served by Spotify, without ever extracting keys or actually re-downloading them.
Conversion and metadata is then applied according to user settings.*
