## What is Spotix + Reborn ?
It's a modified version of Spotify that gives you the ability to skip all the titles you want, have no ads and much more !\

Originally created by Voltan, SpotiX is sadly not being worked on anymore.\
Thus we decided to take over the project, and then SpotiX+ Reborn was born !\

## How to download ?
Go to [Releases](https://github.com/DelofJ/spotixplus-windows/releases) to download the latest version of the program.\
Download it and launch the `script.ps1` file.\
You will need PowerShell 7 to launch the script.\
If it is not on your computer, you can launch it with powershell 5 (installed by default on windows) and the script will automatically install PowerShell 7 on your computer.

## Known bugs
If you have one these messages appearing :
```
The file <chemin>\script.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system
```
```
The file <chemin>\script.ps1 is not digitally signed.
```
Open PowerShell 7, and enter the following command :
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope CurrentUser
```
You should now be able to launch the script !

## I've got other bugs !
Watch in the [Issues](https://github.com/AgoyaSpotix/spotixplus-reborn/issues) tab if someone has the same bug as you, if so send a response saying you also have it.\
Otherwise report it yourself.\
